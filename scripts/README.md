All of these scripts require you to have _Node_ available in your environment.
Get it from [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## substitute_article_urls.js

A node script to replace all Learning Path article links with urls for a particular platform, using [urls.yaml](../config/urls.yaml).

### Usage:
```
npm ci
node substitute_article_urls.js $TARGET
```
For example, to point all links to innersourcecommons.org:
```
node substitute_article_urls.js isc
```

## update_links_in_translations.js

A node script to ensure article links point at the relevant translation if it exists, or default (English) if not.

### Usage:
```
npm ci
node update_links_in_translations.js
```

## generate_learning_path_markdown.js

Node script to generate markdown files required for hosting Learning Path on innersourcecommons.org.

This script requires a [GitHub access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token), as it uses the GitHub API to get Learning Path contributors. Your token does not require any scopes, as the Learning Path is Open Source. To provide this, create a `.env` file in this directory in the following format:
```
TOKEN=<your_github_token>
```

### Usage:
```
npm ci
node generate_learning_path_markdown.js
```

## How to update innersourcecommons.org with new articles

4. Run **generate_learning_path_markdown.js** as described above.
