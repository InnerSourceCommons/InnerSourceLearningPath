## How to update innersourcecommons.org with new articles

Anytime there are _new_ articles written, you need to run the script that generates the new pages on the [innersourcecommons.org] site.

1. Clone the [InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceLearningPath] and [InnerSourceCommons/innersourcecommons.org] repos.
1. Is this the first time that articles have been written for this section in this language?
If so, then do both of the following:

  * update the ["sections" config](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceLearningPath/blob/master/scripts/generate_learning_path_markdown.js#L37) with the language code of the articles for the appropriate section.
Open a pull request for the change.
  * update the [Learning Path landing page](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/innersourcecommons.org/blob/master/resources/learningpath/index.md) with a link to your new language pages.
  
3. Run **generate_learning_path_markdown.js** as described above.
3. `cp -r learningpath/* <path-to-innersourcecommons.org-repo>/resources/learningpath/`.
3. Open a pull request with the modified files in the [InnerSourceCommons/innersourcecommons.org] repo.

Note that these steps only needs to happen when there are new articles written.
Changes to existing articles will automatically show up on the [innersourcecommons.org] site.
