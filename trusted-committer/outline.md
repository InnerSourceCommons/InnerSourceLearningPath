    - Potential future TCs
    - Managers of TCs

## Outline

### Definition

- Glossary
    - Contributor/Guest
        - Responsible for "fitting in"/conforming to the host team and it's
          expectations/processes.
    - Product Owner (distinction between Guest and Host PO)
    - TC
        - TC has rights to push code closer to production than a contributor
        - also known as _Host_
        - has privileges that an admin or Apache committer would have but it is
          a job, irrespective of the permissions. 
        - Maintainer/Owner (conflict with _maintainer_ role in GitHub)
        - Committer is not an IS term. Apache uses this term to denote a tech
          leadership role (TC++)
        - The TC role is defined by its responsibilities, rather than by its
          privileges.

- at PayPal, the discussion surrounding the name of the role was very
  challenging.  i. e.: the name matters.

### Responsibilities

**Tech oriented**
- Keep SW development running smoothly
- Ensure quality and longevity of the SW at a strategic level
- Ensure that decisions regarding quality and longevity of the SW are
  enact/follow/implement/...
- Own decisions regarding the community/process/technology, even if they didn't
  make it themselves.
- Reviewing and accepting contributions (including making sure they conform to
  the guidelines)
- Responsible for communicating contribution guidelines (possibly also
  validating and setting guidelines)
- Responsible for making sure undocumented requirements will be documented 
  (not necessarily do it herself)

**Community oriented**
- TC has to be aware of the communities needs
- TC has to advocate the communities interests
- Reducing the barriers for entry into the community
- Onboarding new contributors
    - Making sure the new contributor is prepared/educated to make the next
      contribution
- Upleveling the capabilities of the community members to use and contribute to
  the project  
    - Mentoring/Coaching during the process of contributors making a
      contribution
- Set up the right process for the community 
- Fostering the community
    - enforcing the code of conduct
- 

### Lifecycle

- There might well be multiple TCs in one project
- 

## Ideas

- Possibly two videos: one for being and one for becoming a TC
- The contributor learning path (LP) video should lay out what a contributor
  can expect from a/his TC
- Idea for a new LP: InnerSource careers
