== Becoming a Trusted Committer

The Trusted Committer role is a very demanding but at the same
time very fulfilling role. If this learning path has interested you in the role of a Trusted Committer, you
might ask yourself: how do I actually become Trusted Committer, and am I the right person to
fill that role?

InnerSource communities follow the same principles that Open Source communities
do, one of which is meritocracy. In a meritocracy, power is vested in
individuals based on their talent, effort and achievement. In other words,
the responsibility and privileges that come with the Trusted Committer role need to be earned.
Transparency, another Open Source value, also plays a vital role in that it
makes the talent, effort and achievements visible to the whole community.

The process of officially becoming a Trusted Committer differs from community to community,
depends on where you are in your InnerSource journey and might evolve over
time. In grass-roots type communities, the founders often automatically assume
the role of the Trusted Committer as well. As a community grows, the community or the
existing Trusted Committers might nominate a https://innersourcecommons.org/resources/learningpath/contributor/index[_contributor_] to become Trusted Committer, which might or might
not be subject to a community vote. Ideally, nominated contributors should take
on the Trusted Committer role voluntarily, as that indicates a high level of commitment.

What are the criteria to apply in nominating https://innersourcecommons.org/resources/learningpath/contributor/index[_contributors_] for a Trusted Committer role? What
does it take to successfully fill the role of a Trusted Committer? First off, potential Trusted Committers
need to have demonstrated a deep, technical competence during their work in the
community. In addition to that, they must have proven their ability to
effectively communicate with peers in the community and ideally also with
product owners and with management, as that's a key part of the Trusted Committer role.

In the same vein, they must have shown the willingness and patience to use
their skills and spend intentional time to uplevel contributors so that they
can make more contributions than they could have on their own. Finally,
fulfilling the Trusted Committer role requires a certain emotional maturity in order to be
able to deal with stressful social situations, which are bound to come up from
time to time. Contributors who satisfy these criteria will be good potential
Trusted Committers, in our opinion.

For some https://innersourcecommons.org/resources/learningpath/contributor/index[_contributors_], the Trusted Committer role might not appear all that attractive as it
means spending less time on coding. Being nominated as a Trusted Committer might even be
perceived by some as a demotion or a negative comment on their coding skills.
The opposite is true. Being nominated as a Trusted Committer is most often a sign that someone
has recognized your potential to grow and that you are indeed already growing,
personally. The Trusted Committer role will give you more influence over the evolution of the
codebase. That and the wider perspective the Trusted Committer role affords will
arguably make you a more complete developer. And as any trainer will be
tell you, explaining something to someone else, in the Trusted Committer's case
explaining to contributors how the software works, more often than not leads to
new insights on part of the Trusted Committer and will help to identify opportunities to
improve the software.

Whether or not you have only one or multiple Trusted Committers depends on the size and the
risk associated with the software developed in the InnerSource community. 
The Trusted Committer role is time consuming and not everyone is willing or empowered to spend 100%
of their time as Trusted Committer. Some companies have therefore enacted a _Trusted Committer rotation_
where multiple Trusted Committers share the workload of the Trusted Committer role and the Trusted Committers who are not _on
duty_ could exclusively focus on tech oriented work. Another reason to have
multiple Trusted Committers is to prepare for the inevitable case that some Trusted Committers can no longer
take on their responsibilities, e.g. because they are changing to another
position in the company or because they leave it. In that case, it is important
that there are other Trusted Committers in place already, who can take over and ensure
continuity in the community.

In summary, the Trusted Committer role has to be earned in the community by making valuable
contributions - both technical contributions and social contributions for the
benefit of the community. In a healthy community, you will have fellow Trusted Committers at
your side.  As a Trusted Committer, you will have less time to code yourself. However, by
acting as a force multiplier you will ultimately be able to boost your value
contribution to the community and accelerate your own growth.
