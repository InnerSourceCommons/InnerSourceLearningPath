## Introducing The Trusted Committer Role

The Trusted Committer (TC) role is one of the key roles in an InnerSource
community. Think of TCs as the people in a community that you trust with
important technical decisions and with mentoring contributors in order to get
their contribution over the finish line. The TC role is both a demanding and a
rewarding role to fulfill. It goes far beyond being an opinionated gatekeeper
and it is instrumental for the success of any InnerSource community. 

Generally speaking, the TC role is defined by its responsibilities, rather than
by its privileges. On a very high level, TCs represent the interests of both
their InnerSource community and the products the community is building. They
are concerned with the health of both the community and the product. So as a
TC, you'll have both tech oriented and community oriented responsibilities.  We'll
explore both of these dimensions in the following sections. 

Before we go into the details of what a TC actually does, let's spend some time
contrasting the TC role to other roles in InnerSource on a high level of abstraction and
explain why we think the name is both apt and important.  Let's
start with the _Contributor_ role. A _Contributor_ - as the name implies -
makes contributions to an InnerSource community.  These contributions could be code or non-code
artifacts, such as bug-reports, feature-requests or documentation.
_Contributors_ might or might not be part of the community. They might be sent by
another team to develop a feature that team might need. This is why we
sometimes also refer to _Contributors_ as _Guests_ or being part of a _Guest
Team_. The _Contributor_ is responsible for "fitting in" and for conforming to the
community's expectations and processes.

The _Trusted Committer_ is always a member of the InnerSource community, which
also sometimes referred to as the _Host Team_. In this analogy, the TC is
responsible for both building the house and setting the house rules, to make
sure their guests are comfortable and can work together effectively. Compared
to contributors, TCs have earned the responsibility to push code closer to
production and are generally allowed to perform tasks that have a higher level
of risk associated with them.

The _Product Owner_ (PO) is the third role in InnerSource.  Similar to agile
processes, the PO is responsible for defining and prioritizing requirements and
stories for the community to implement. The PO interacts often with the
TC, e.g. in making sure that a requested or contributed feature actually
belongs to the product. Especially in smaller, grass-roots type InnerSource
communities, the TC usually also acts as a PO. Please check out our Product
Owner Learning Path segment for more detailed information.

## Why role names matter

The role of the TC is present in every successful InnerSource community but not
every community uses that name. Some communities use the term Maintainer, but
it turns out that conflicts with the technical role "Maintainer" defined by
GitHub, for instance.  Apache uses the term _Committer_, too, but they attach
fewer and mostly tech oriented responsibilities to that role. The TC role with
its additional community oriented responsibilities goes beyond that.  The
"Trusted" in TC conveys that they are trusted and thus empowered by both their
management and their community to do their job. By fostering openness and
transparency, TCs build trust in the process and also in the product being
built.

So similar to how naming is important in writing software, it is for the
roles in an InnerSource project as well. Choosing the right names and doing so
consistently ensures that everyone has the same notion of the role and how it
serves the community.

Now you should hav a basic understanding of the role, why using the term
trusted committer is appropriate, and understand how a trusted committer might
interact with other common roles in a souftware project.

## Responsibilities

In the following segments, we'll dive into the various responsibilities that
TCs have:

- ensuring product quality,
- keeping the community healthy,
- reducing the barrier to making contributions,
- uplevelling the community,
- advocating the communities needs.

In addition to this, we will also explore the path of becoming a TC in the end
of this article.
