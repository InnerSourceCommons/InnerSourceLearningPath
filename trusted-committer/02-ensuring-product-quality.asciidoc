== Ensuring product quality

Let's start with the responsibility most often associated with the Trusted Committer role:
ensuring product quality.

In an InnerSource community, the Trusted Committers _own_ all tech related decisions,
especially those related to product quality. Ownership implies that Trusted Committers need
to make sure the decisions in place are followed through.  This includes
communicating and - if necessary - advocating these decisions, inside and outside
of the community. Trusted Committers don't necessarily make all the tech related decisions
themselves or do all the work to implement them.

It is the Trusted Committer's job to communicate and motivate quality standards in their
community and to formulate them in a way that is understandable and actionable
by their https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceLearningPath/blob/master/contributor/01-introduction-article.asciidoc[_Contributors_]. This includes written documentation, of course. But the
most effective way for Trusted Committers to communicate this is to set an example for the
expected quality standard themselves. We think it can be a worthwhile goal for
an InnerSource community to try and distinguish itself from traditional
software development projects not just in the way they organize development but
also in the quality of the software they produce, as well. A high software quality is
essential for building trust in an InnerSource community on part of their users
and their management and we all know how one bad release can shatter this trust
in an instant.

The Trusted Committers also make sure that the community has the infrastructure and the tools
they need to produce quality software. The tool that Trusted Committers will use most
frequently for ensuring quality is the peer review, usually performed as part
of pull requests. While everybody can usually start and participate in pull
requests by pointing out necessary improvements, it is usually only the Trusted Committers who
can ultimately accept and merge or reject a contribution. That is what we meant
when we said "Trusted Committers can push code closer to production" earlier.  Trusted Committers should also
help https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceLearningPath/blob/master/contributor/01-introduction-article.asciidoc[_Contributors_] during a PR to get their contribution over the finish line.

That said, it is ultimately the contributor's job to make that happen. The job
of a Trusted Committer is not to accept all contributions by default, but to only accept those
who meet the defined criteria in terms of quality and scope.  And Trusted Committers should
avoid rewriting contributor's code to make it "`fit`" as much as possible, even
if it means spend way more time supporting the https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceLearningPath/blob/master/contributor/01-introduction-article.asciidoc[_Contributors_] in a PR compared
to doing it themselves.  Trusted Committers take a long term perspective and understand that
this kind of support is an investment both in the longevity of the community
and the speed at which it will move forward.

Coming back to the project scope: sometimes requirements or limitations for
the software being developed are not elicited up front but rather discovered
during development. Trusted Committers are also responsible for making sure these findings are
captured and documented for both the https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceLearningPath/blob/master/product-owner/01-opening-article.asciidoc[_Product Owners_] and the https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceLearningPath/blob/master/contributor/01-introduction-article.asciidoc[_Contributors_].

The Trusted Committers purview with respect to quality goes beyond pull requests, though. Trusted Committers think
about quality on a strategic level and ensure the longevity of the software
being built. That entails code oriented responsibilities from ensuring
cleanliness of the code to maintaining conceptual integrity of the overall
software. It also entails more management oriented tasks such as making sure
that the community is given sufficient time to refactor their software or move
a release date in favor of quality improvements, if the community deems that
necessary. The effectiveness of the Trusted Committer is strongly related to code health.

Absent the latter, the Trusted Committer will have to spend much of their valuable time
validating and documenting workarounds for bugs or a fragile architecture
and will not have enough time to spend on onboarding and mentoring
https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceLearningPath/blob/master/contributor/01-introduction-article.asciidoc[_Contributors_].


In conclusion, ensuring product quality is a key responsibility of Trusted Committers. They set
quality standards and lead by example.  They participate in pull requests and
help https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceLearningPath/blob/master/contributor/01-introduction-article.asciidoc[_Contributors_] with their contributions to meet the quality standards.  They
also take responsibility for the long term health of the software.
