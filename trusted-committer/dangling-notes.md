# Dangling notes

## More general
- Consider meet-ups to get a hold of people who might be interested to contribute or consume however are not known to the hosts s.t. that the could invite them.
- Provide a more-or-less synchronous, freely self-joinable channel, i.e. Slack, IRC, WebEx having consumers, contributors and TCs
- Think about and have a solution for: Reaction time expectations management in cases of larger time zone differences, e.g. us/europe, between developers, TCs, contributors and consumers.
- As a host/TC: be prepared for more-junior-than-expected people or people who might have more different views on code style or related approaches e.g. tests, coverage, libraries, etc. than you expect. Might be a good idea to have something on what and why you want something for your project in your contributing.md on that. As a host: bring a wide mental horizon.
- Provide a bit of extra effort for first time contributors to make them happy and stay with the project / overcome initial trust hurdles of "this project is alive and would care about my contributions, thus it is worth investing time in the first place" [1]

## More technical
- How to actually write a good CONTRIBUTING.md (and README.md)
	- have timezones expectations there
	- keep docs near the code or clearly indicate what belongs where and keep things in the right places to enable people to actually find them (passively existing information vs. Active useable knowledge in humans)
	- regularly check validity of documentation to not waste your contributors time (them providing good+correct docs and actually peruse/unblock them)
