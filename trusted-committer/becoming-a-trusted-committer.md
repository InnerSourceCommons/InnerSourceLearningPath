## Becoming a Trusted Committer 

The TC role is a very demanding but at the same
time very fulfilling role. If this learning path has interested you in the role of a TC, you
might ask yourself: how do I actually become TC, and am I the right person to
fill that role?

InnerSource communities follow the same principles that Open Source communities
do, one of which is meritocracy. In a meritocracy, power is vested in
individuals based on their talent, effort and achievement. In other words,
the responsibility and privileges that come with the TC role need to be earned.
Transparency, another Open Source value, also plays a vital role in that it
makes the talent, effort and achievements visible to the whole community.

The process of officially becoming a TC differs from community to community,
depends on where you are in your InnerSource journey and might evolve over
time. In grass-roots type communities, the founders often automatically assume
the role of the TC as well. As a community grows, the community or the
existing TCs might nominate a contributor to become TC, which might or might
not be subject to a community vote. Ideally, nominated contributors should take
on the TC role voluntarily, as that indicates a high level of committment.

What are the criteria to apply in nominating contributors for a TC role? What
does it take to successfully fill the role of a TC? First off, potential TCs
need to have demonstrated a deep, technical competence during their work in the
community. In addition to that, they must have proven their ability to
effectively communicate with peers in the community and ideally also with
product owners and with management, as that's a key part of the TC role.
In the same vein, they must have shown the willingness and patience to use
their skills and spend intentional time to uplevel contributors so that they
can make more contributions than they could have on their own. Finally,
fulfilling the TC role requires a certain emotional maturity in order to be
able to deal with stressful social situations, which are bound to come up from
time to time. Contributors who satisfy these criteria will be good potential
TCs, in our opinion. 

For some contributors, the TC role might not appear all that attractive as it
means spending less time on coding. Being nominated as a TC might even be
perceived by some as a demotion or a negative comment on their coding skills.
The opposite is true. Being nominated as a TC is most often a sign that someone
has recognized your potential to grow and that you are indeed already growing,
personally. The TC role will give you more influence over the evolution of the
codebase. That and the wider perspective the TC role affords will
arguably make you a more complete developer. And as any trainer will be
tell you, explaining something to someone else, in the TC's case
explaining to contributors how the software works, more often than not leads to
new insights on part of the TC and will help to identify opportunities to
improve the software.

Whether or not you have only one or multiple TCs depends on the size and the
risk associated with the software developed in the InnerSource community. The
TC role is time consuming and not everyone is willing or empowered to spend 100%
of their time as TC. Some companies have therefore enacted a _TC rotation_
where multiple TCs share the workload of the TC role and the TCs who are not _on
duty_ could exclusively focus on tech oriented work. Another reason to have
multiple TCs is to prepare for the inevitable case that some TCs can no longer
take on their responsibilities, e.g. because they are changing to another
position in the company or because they leave it. In that case, it is important
that there are other TCs in place already, who can take over and ensure
continuity in the community.

In summary, the TC role has to be earned in the community by making valuable
contributions - both technical contributions and social contributions for the
benefit of the community. In a healthy community, you will have fellow TCs at
your side.  As a TC, you will have less time to code yourself. However, by
acting as a force multiplier you will ultimately be able to boost your value
contribution to the community and accelerate your own growth.
