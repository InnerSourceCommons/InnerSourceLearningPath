00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.400
Hi.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.740
So, this segment is going to explain how InnerSource works,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.178
from a high level,

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:15.314
and with a drawing with a diagram that we've used a lot of times

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.500
to help people understand how this is going to work.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.600
We're going to talk about the common roles that are involved and how they interact.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.080
So, let's start with an Engineer.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.940
Here's the Engineer, and he is working on this code base here.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.340
Which might be a feature. It might be an app.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.520
But he needs to change something in one of the main code bases over here.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.160
And, so he wants to submit a change request, or a pull request.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.148 line:0%
He's not submitting a feature request.

00:00:53.148 --> 00:00:56.818 line:0%
He's not requesting work from the people that work on this code base.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.260 line:0%
He's actually giving them code that will get the effect that he's looking for.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.125 line:100%
Because he's read the code in the silo,

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:07.395
and, he thinks he knows how to fix it for what he needs.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.200
So he submits a pull request.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.440
Now, the second role is the Trusted Committer.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.740
Here's the Trusted Committer. We're going to make her be a woman.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.000
And, she has been given the job during this period of work, or this sprint,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.460
to review all the code that is supposed to be merged into this silo,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.940 line:0%
whether it's coming from her own people on the team,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.780 line:0%
or, from somebody thats outside the team --  which is InnerSource.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.600 line:100%
When its happening with her own people, thats just normal work.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.027
Although we find that, often,

00:01:43.027 --> 00:01:47.231
adding a Trusted Committer to the system means that code reviews become real.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.767
Because her job during this time is to not accept code

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:53.937
that is going to be difficult to maintain.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.160
Because she's accepting ownership. Its like getting a puppy.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.280
Right.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.520
Now we're going to talk about the roles of Host and Guest.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.814
So, this person is the Guest in this transaction.

00:02:05.814 --> 00:02:07.449
And this person is the Host.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.580 line:0%
Think about when you stay at somebody's house.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.100 line:0%
You're the Guest. You're arriving.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.480 line:0%
And you have to conform, at least to a certain extent, to the Host's house rules.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.680 line:100%
So maybe the Host wants you to take your shoes off before you walk around inside.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.200
And you figure that out, or they tell you.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.320
You know you're not expected to figure it out just on your own.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.520
Usually, they'll tell you if they want you to do something differently.

00:02:30.903 --> 00:02:32.538
And you're going to be a good Guest.

00:02:32.538 --> 00:02:34.306
You're going to be polite and you're going to do what they ask

00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:35.874
as long as its reasonable.

00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:37.809
And then, on their side,

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.112
they want to be a good Host. They want you to come back.

00:02:40.112 --> 00:02:41.480
They want you to be comfortable.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.882
So they're going to offer you-  they're going to be polite.

00:02:43.882 --> 00:02:47.018
They're going to offer you, you know, a comfortable place.

00:02:47.018 --> 00:02:48.452
Some privacy.

00:02:48.452 --> 00:02:50.821
Whatever you need to be comfortable in their space.

00:02:51.288 --> 00:02:54.880
That transaction is very similar to what we want to see in InnerSource.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.520
We want the Engineer to be polite in his request.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.460
And we want the Trusted Committer to be very polite in their response.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.268
Because you know,

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.737
civil discourse being what it is, they'll get further. Both of them will.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.880
So, this Trusted Committer is going to read the code.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.580
And she is going to send back some written comments.

00:03:15.877 --> 00:03:17.740
This is a form of mentorship.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.580
She's going to say

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.384
"Gosh I'm sorry that you used this method. It wasn't documented very well."

00:03:23.384 --> 00:03:26.387
"But we know that this is not going to work at the scale that you need..."

00:03:26.387 --> 00:03:27.621
"...this thing to work at."

00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:32.025
Or, "You haven't declared your variables in the way that we like to do it."

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:33.827
"Could you please do it this other way?"

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.131
Or, any number of other possible things.

00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:39.565
"We're writing the same feature..."

00:03:39.565 --> 00:03:43.302
"...and its going to come out in the next release so maybe you just want to use ours."

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.660
Lots of different things that they might say.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.640
But, what they don't do is rewrite the code.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.680
Because, now, this Engineer has the opportunity to resubmit.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.560
And the Trusted Committer will re-comment.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.984
And they might go around a few times

00:03:59.984 --> 00:04:05.188
before they get to a place where this pull request can actually be merged.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.040
And that'll be a great thing.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.920
Right?

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.900
So now let's talk about one more role which is important in most corporations.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.820
There is the Planning role.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.768
So, I already said that this woman doesn't have to accept anything that isn't

00:04:19.768 --> 00:04:21.236
high enough quality.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.372
Or, is somehow, you know, out in left field

00:04:24.372 --> 00:04:27.342
to the charter of, of what they're trying to get done.

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:31.660
In most organizations, there's central planning that kind of takes

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.220
that particular discernment out of her hands a little bit,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.300
and puts it in the hands of someone called the Product Owner.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.991
So the Product Owner -- and they're usually symmetrical, there's usually two of them --

00:04:46.893 --> 00:04:51.460 line:0%
will have a conversation, often, before this guy ever submits this.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.567 line:0%
In an Agile shop, the Product Owners will write the stories

00:04:55.567 --> 00:04:57.469 line:0%
that are sent down to the Engineers, as

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.337 line:0%
"Here's the work you have to get done today."

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.300 line:100%
And in some companies, notably PayPal, they will also say,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.678
"And this one we think will be done best through InnerSource."

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.380
So, some of that work is done ahead of time.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.284
This guy already knows that he's going to be submitting to this place, and

00:05:14.284 --> 00:05:15.118
this Trusted Committer

00:05:15.118 --> 00:05:17.587
already knows that there's going to be a submission coming.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.580
It helps them plan a little bit better.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.800
And between the three roles they can get the best outcome for all parties concerned.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.600
So that the code is continually good, high-quality, and manageable.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.560
So that this individual can get their work done as quickly as they need to.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.237
And so that the whole organization can move forward with

00:05:36.237 --> 00:05:38.973
the kinds of work that is going to do the business the best.
