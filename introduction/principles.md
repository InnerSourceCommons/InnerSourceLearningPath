# Inner Source Principles

Every company, team, project, and individual is different.
Because of that fact, the exact way that the concept of inner source works will vary from one situation to another.
At its core, however, are two principles that form the bedrock of any successful instance of inner source.
These principles have inspiration in successful open source projects and must be respected and present in order for inner source to achieve the benefits described earlier.

The principles are:
* **Prioritized Mentorship**
* **Voluntary Code Contribution**

Let's take a look at each of these principles in more detail.

## Prioritized Mentorship

_Mentorship_ from host team to guest team via trusted committers is a key aspect of inner source.
Contributors on guest teams are upleveled so that they understand enough about the host team system to change it successfully.
In the process of doing so, they come to better understand the host team system as a general consumer.
They can use it more effectively and help other consumers to do so as well.

It's critical that this mentorship for contributors is _Prioritized_ by the host team.
The team strives to make trusted committer time available to mentor guest team contributors _at the time that they need it_ as opposed to when it is convenient.
At times at may be a culture change for engineers on the host team to spend time helping others to code rather than just coding themselves.
This mentorship is valuable to the individuals involved and the company in general and is worth doing well.
Open source readily recognizes this point and considers it as an honor to achieve trusted committership on a project.

## Voluntary Code Contribution

The first word _Voluntary_ means that engagement in inner source from both the guest and host teams occurs of their own free will.
The guest team voluntarily donates code to the host team and the host team voluntarily accepts it.
This opt-in nature means that each team needs to be certain that their involvement adds value to the others' objectives.
Never is a host team required to accept a contribution that isn't in ultimate alignment with their overall mission.
Never is a guest team required to submit a contribution that doesn't ultimately further their own mission and priorities.

The word _Code_ emphasizes that the collaboration between guest and host goes all the way to the code.
Guest involvement in opening issues, updating requirements, fixing docs, etc. is good, but collaboration needs to reach as far as submitting code to achieve all of the benefits that we've discussed.
