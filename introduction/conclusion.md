This accompanying text will appear as a part of the learning path (like [this example](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/learning-paths/learning-path-lean/9781491999738/9781491946527-/part01ch01.html)).

# Conclusion

In this learning path, we've given an introduction to inner source.
Inner source applies open source best practices and principles to internal software development.
It gives an additional option to consumers when producing teams are not able to deliver a needed feature request.
Successful inner source involves a **product owner** and **trusted committer** from the **host team** as well as a **contributor** from the **guest team**.
Done effectively, inner source brings many benefits to both participating teams.
They key principles upon-which effective inner source works are **voluntary code contribution** and **prioritized mentorship**.

While this training contains a high-level overview of inner source, there are many more details useful in making inner source actually work for your team.
If you want to stay connected to the ongoing conversation around inner source and its best practices, then join [the InnerSource Commons](http://innersourcecommons.org).
The commons sponsors a Slack channel, an inner source patterns working group, and multiple in-person summits each year.
We're also planning to introduce more segments in this learning path outlining detail around the product owner, trusted committer, and contributor roles.
Announcements on the availabilty of future learning path segments will be made in the commons.
Participation in the commons is a great way to stay connected with the latest in inner source.
