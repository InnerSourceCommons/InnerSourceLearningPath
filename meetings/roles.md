This document describes the various roles involved with running the meetings involved in the production of the learning path.
All of these roles should be filled and completed for each meeting to be as successful as possible.
The roles are:

* [Scheduler]
* [Crier]
* [Facilitator]
* [Scribe]

<a name="scheduler"></a>
## Scheduler

The _Scheduler_ sends the calendar invite for the meeting.

**Within 24 Hours of Previous Meeting**
* [ ] Visit the [learning path folder].
* [ ] Right-click on `Meeting - 2019 - MM - DD`.
* [ ] Select `Make a copy`.
* [ ] Replace `MM` and `DD` in the document name with the two-digit month and day of the upcoming meeting.
* [ ] Open the document and follow the steps in the **Do these things to set up this document** section.
* [ ] Send the calendar invite for the next meeting.
This invite must include:

  * Conference call info.
  * Comment-enabled link to the agenda document.

### Tips

* The _Scribe_ should have included the time of the meeting in the notes from the previous meeting. 
* Include everyone from the previous meeting on the invite for the next meeting.
An easy way to do this is to use the _Reply with meeting_ function to the notes email from the previous meeting.
* The title of the meeting should be "Inner Source Learning Path Working Session".
* You can use your favorite corporate conference call system or create a Google Hangout.
* Check out this [writeup][gdoc sharing] if you need help creating a comment-enabled link to the agenda document.

## Crier

The _Crier_ reminds people in _Slack_ of the upcoming meeting.

**About 24 Hours Before Meeting**

* [ ] Announce the meeting in the [#learning-path] channel.
* [ ] Share that announcement with the [#innersourcecommons] channel.

### Tips

* Ensure that the announcement has enough information for people to join the meeting _even if they don't have the calendar invite_.
That means at a minimum the announcement has the meeting day, time, and call info.
* Try to make the announcement engaging so that even people that have not participated before may be interested in joining.
A good way to do that is to copy the agenda text from the invite into the announcement.
* Here is an [example announcement][#learning-path announcement] in the [#learning-path] channel and [its share][#innersourcecommons share] in the [#innersourcecommons] channel.

## Facilitator

The _Facilitator_ conducts the meeting so that all of the agenda items are finished within the allotted time.

**Day Before Meeting**

* [ ] Review the agenda and ensure that you are reasonably familiar with each item on it.

**During Meeting**

* [ ] Facilitate the meeting according to the **Tips** below.

### Tips

* Have the agenda open and share your screen with the people on the call.
* Guide the group through reviewing each agenda item from top to bottom.
* Before discussing each item, briefly remind people of what it is so that they're up to speed and can contribute to the conversation).
* The purpose of reviewing each agenda item is to generate actionable, assigned next steps.  Accordingly:

  * Guide the conversation towards understanding what is blocking the item's progression and what can be done to advance it.
  * Strive for each task to be assigned to a volunteer on the call.
  * When all such tasks have been assigned, move on to the next agenda item.
  
* When reviewing the project board:

  * Treat each issue in the **In Review** and **In Progress** columns as if it were its own item on the agenda.
  * The **Done** column does not need review.
  * Call out if anyone would like to review any issue in the **To Do** column.
  If so, then treat that issue like a regular agenda item.
  If not, then no further discussion is needed.

* Remember that it's OK to finish early.
Once the agenda is complete the meeting is over.
* At the close of the call thank everyone for participating.

## Scribe

The _Scribe_ ensures that meeting notes are taken and sends them out.

**Day Before Meeting**

* [ ] Reserve time on tomorrow's calendar to transcribe and clean up everyone's writing into the **Notes** section of the agenda document.
This time should be scheduled as close as possible after the end of the meeting.

**During Meeting**

* [ ] Note the first names of each meeting attendee.
* [ ] At the beginning, encourage everyone to type in salient points and assignments directly into the document.
* [ ] Watch closely what is being typed to ensure that all salient points and assignments make it in.
Make note to yourself of any missed information.

**Within 24 Hours of Meeting**

* [ ] Clean up everyone's notes plus your own into a cohesive set of salient points and assignments of the meeting.
Be sure to include the time of next meeting.
* [ ] These polished notes should be in the **Notes** section of the agenda document.
* [ ] Announce in the [#learning-path] channel that the notes are in the agenda document.
In your announcement include a sharing link to the document itself.
* [ ] Email the notes to everyone on the meeting invite.
This email should include (in order):

  * Link to the agenda document where the notes are located.
  * Chatham House Rule disclaimer.
  * Copy/pasted notes from the agenda document.
  

### Tips

* Ensure that a regular attendee who is not at the meeting could understand what happened by the notes only.
* Make sure the notes are clear and to the point.
Part of your service as _Scribe_ is to summarize the key points of what was said
so that recipients don't need to wade through all of the conversation in order to understand its essentials.
* Here is a [sample notes announcement].
* Here is a [sample email].
* An easy way to send the notes to everyone on the meeting invite is to "Reply all" to the invite.
