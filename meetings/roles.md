* [Crier]
* [Facilitator]
* [Scribe]

<a name="scheduler"></a>
## Scheduler

The _Scheduler_ sends the calendar invite for the meeting.

**Within 24 Hours of Previous Meeting**
* [ ] Update the shared calendar series with any new invitees from the last call.  
* [ ] Visit the [learning path folder].
* [ ] Right-click on `Meeting - 2022 - MM - DD`.
* [ ] Select `Make a copy`.
* [ ] Replace `MM` and `DD` in the document name with the two-digit month and day of the upcoming meeting.
* [ ] Open the document and follow the steps in the **Do these things to set up this document** section.
* [ ] Update the calendar invite for the next meeting to add:

  * Write-enabled link to the agenda document.
  * Copy/pasted role assignments and agenda detail.

### Tips

* Check out this [writeup][gdoc sharing] if you need help creating a write-enabled link to the agenda document.
* Get permission to the `InnerSource Commons Calendar` from [@Lenucksi] and then access the [shared calendar].

## Crier

The _Crier_ reminds people in _Slack_ of the upcoming meeting.

* [ ] Announce the meeting in the [#learning-path] channel.
* [ ] Use the `Share` arrow icon to share that announcement with the [#general] channel.

### Tips

* Ensure that the announcement has enough information for people to join the meeting _even if they don't have the calendar invite_.
That means at a minimum the announcement has the meeting day, time, and call info.
* Try to make the announcement engaging so that even people that have not participated before may be interested in joining.
A good way to do that is to copy the agenda text from the invite into the announcement.
* You can find link to the agenda document in the calendar invite for the upcoming meeting.
* Here is an [example announcement][#learning-path announcement] in the [#learning-path] channel and [its share][#innersourcecommons share] in the [#general] channel.

## Facilitator

The _Facilitator_ conducts the meeting so that all of the agenda items are finished within the allotted time.

**Day Before Meeting**

* [ ] Review the agenda and ensure that you are reasonably familiar with each item on it.

**During Meeting**

* [ ] Facilitate the meeting according to the **Tips** below.

### Tips

* Have the agenda open and share your screen with the people on the call.
* Guide the group through reviewing each agenda item from top to bottom.
* Before discussing each item, briefly remind people of what it is so that they're up to speed and can contribute to the conversation).
* The purpose of reviewing each agenda item is to generate actionable, assigned next steps.  Accordingly:

  * Guide the conversation towards understanding what is blocking the item's progression and what can be done to advance it.
  * Strive for each task to be assigned to a volunteer on the call.
  * When all such tasks have been assigned, move on to the next agenda item.
  
* When reviewing the project board:

  * Treat each issue in the **In Review** and **In Progress** columns as if it were its own item on the agenda.
  * The **Done** column does not need review.
  * Call out if anyone would like to review any issue in the **To Do** column.
  If so, then treat that issue like a regular agenda item.
  If not, then no further discussion is needed.

* Remember that it's OK to finish early.
Once the agenda is complete the meeting is over.
* At the close of the call thank everyone for participating.

## Scribe

The _Scribe_ ensures that meeting notes are taken and sends them out.

**During Meeting**

* [ ] Note the first names of each meeting attendee.
* [ ] Record a simple, short summary of each discussion in the **Key Points** section.
* [ ] Record all assignments in the **Assignments** section.

**After Meeting**

* [ ] Announce in the [#learning-path] channel that the notes are in the agenda document.
In your announcement include a sharing link to the document itself.
* [ ] Email the notes to everyone on the meeting invite.
This email should include (in order):

  * Link to the agenda document where the notes are located.
  * Chatham House Rule disclaimer.
  * Copy/pasted notes from the agenda document.

See this [sample email].

### Tips

* Ensure that a regular attendee who is not at the meeting could understand what happened by the notes only.
* Make sure the notes are clear and to the point.
Part of your service as _Scribe_ is to summarize the key points of what was said
so that recipients don't need to wade through all of the conversation in order to understand its essentials.
* Here is a [sample notes announcement].
* Here is a [sample email].
* An easy way to send the notes to everyone on the meeting invite is to "Reply all" to the invite.
