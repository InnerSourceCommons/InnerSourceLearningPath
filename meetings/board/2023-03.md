Work in the learning path continued over the past quarter.

* [Senthil Nathan] has rallied native speakers to complete 3 translations of Italian content:
  - [Introducing the Trusted Committer Role (it)]
  - [Ensuring Product Quality (it)]
  - [Keeping the Community Healthy (it)]
* [Laura Little] has completed many wonderful updates for the display of the Learning Path on the website:
  - Checked-in, well-positioned captions.
  - Updated images for workbook pages or articles without a corresponding video.
* [Isabel Drost-Fromm] has an in-flight-contribution around a learning section for Product people.
It has been slowly progressing but is almost ready for merge.
It will be our first new section in a long time.
* There were 3 other contributors to the learning path, who made small wording or typo fixes in our localized content.
* [Laura Little] and [Senthil Nathan] have been contributing to the Learning Path and helping to run the Learning Path long enough to be recognized as Trusted Committers!
Congratulations to them!
Both are located in the United States.
* Other existing Trusted Committers have mostly moved on to other areas of the InnerSource Commons.
With this situation, we're at a minimal level of support for the working group.
* In the upcoming quarter, we expect that more translations will come in (led by [Senthil Nathan]) and we will publish the new section for Product people.
