# InnerSource and capacity planning


## Setting expectations

* write down when contributors can expect to hear back from you
* hearing back does not equal merge of pr
* write down which path you prefer for getting a ping if contributors don't hear back from you


## Small vs. large changes

* smaller changes easier to handle, but for small changes that belong together there should be a place where that context is communicated
* "patches welcome" is a nice way out of the "feature request" mental model - but it does still have a cost which is called time to mentor contributors


## Increasing the team around your InnerSource project

* contribtors can become team members and thus increase the time and number of people helping you
* needs a long term vision
* host team needs to have that in mind when mentoring contribtors.
