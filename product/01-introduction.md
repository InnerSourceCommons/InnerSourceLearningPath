Welcome to the learning path segment for product managers.
After watching this segment you will have a better understanding of how InnerSource relates to Agile development best practices.
While we all strive for autonomous teams that can move in an independent way it is clear that in an complex interconnected world some dependencies cannot be avoided.
InnerSource provides a way to out of "wait it out", "build workarounds" and "escalate": Teams that need modifications in their dependencies can themselves offer a helping hand.
InnerSource facilitates cross team collaboration.
Through it's focus on written communication InnerSource values are particularly helpful for teams moving to a remote first mode.

In this Learning Path segment you will learn where Agile development and InnerSource use similar terminology and even technology - but differ substantially in the details.
Instead of running into common misunderstandings you will be better equiped to spot differences in culture but also in purpose of tools used.

In the fourth part of the segment you will learn more about the impact of InnerSource on capacity planning: Also with InnerSource there is no free lunch - host teams will have to be aware of mentoring efforts to get contributors up to speed and mentoring them through at least the first few of their contributions.
In addition we will look at the additional negotiation possibilities that InnerSource brings - keeping the balance of Give and Take.
