Welcome to the learning path section for product managers.
After watching this segment, you will have a better understanding of how InnerSource speeds up product development.
We will also cover how it relates to Agile development best practices.

To achive agility organizations strive for autonomous teams.
However in a complex, interconnected world some dependencies cannot be avoided.
InnerSource [provides an alternative](https://innersourcecommons.org/learn/learning-path/introduction/02/) to "wait it out", "build workarounds" and "escalate": Teams that need modifications in their dependencies can offer a helping hand.
InnerSource facilitates cross team collaboration.
Through its focus on written communication, it is well suited even for remote-first mode.

In this section, you will learn where Agile development and InnerSource use similar terminology and even technology - but differ substantially in the details.
Instead of running into common misunderstandings, you will benefit from knowing the differences in culture but also in purpose of tools used.

You will understand the impact of InnerSource on capacity planning. Also with InnerSource there is no free lunch - host teams need time for mentoring contributors.
We will also look at the additional negotiation possibilities that InnerSource brings - keeping the balance of Give and Take.
