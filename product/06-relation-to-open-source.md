# Relation to open source

* So you're now an export on InnerSource - where's the line to when to switch to Open Source?

* The practices are very similar
* Visibility and who can participate is limited in InnerSource
* There are tax implications for InnerSource collaboration that do not exist for Open Source

* The concept of building a common platform together and competing on top of that is core to Open Source as well.
* What's more important though: InnerSource gets you into a habit of thinking about moving changes and thus maintenance one level up into your dependencies.
That same habit can help you move changes upstream into Open Source projects that you depend on.
* Thinking through the governance levels for InnerSource also helps you understand that not all Open Source projects are born the same.
As a result you may want to take governance levels of Open Source projects which offer similar functionality into account when deciding which one to adopt in your tech stack.
