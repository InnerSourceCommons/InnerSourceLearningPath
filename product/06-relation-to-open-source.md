# Relation to open source

InnerSource is the application of Open Source collaboration best practices inside of the confines of corporations.
This makes understanding two aspects of Open Source easier for teams through parallels with InnerSource:

## Governance levels

Much like in InnerSource open source projects come with governance levels.
Not all open source projects are created equal: While some groups only publish the source code, expecting no interaction, others want downstream users to become active and submit patches.
Other projects have processes setup to allow for sharing impact on the open source project.
Understanding these governance levels means that deciding which open source project to use in house will take open source governance into consideration as well.
A downstream user of an InnerSource project will have learnt to correctly evaluate the balance between moving fast but being unable to influence a project vs. moving at a slower pace but being able to influence a project together.

## Building a platform together

Working in InnerSource projects helps teams practice what it means to share the cost and effort to build platforms together.
Sharing the work across teams helps innovate faster overall.
It also means that individual teams can focus on their respective unique innovations.
That makes it easier to understand the concept of how sharing effort can help to make the pie bigger for everyone.
It helps teams understand how collaboration means that 

* So you're now an export on InnerSource - where's the line to when to switch to Open Source?

* The practices are very similar
* Visibility and who can participate is limited in InnerSource
* There are tax implications for InnerSource collaboration that do not exist for Open Source

* The concept of building a common platform together and competing on top of that is core to Open Source as well.
* What's more important though: InnerSource gets you into a habit of thinking about moving changes and thus maintenance one level up into your dependencies.
That same habit can help you move changes upstream into Open Source projects that you depend on.
* Thinking through the governance levels for InnerSource also helps you understand that not all Open Source projects are born the same.
As a result you may want to take governance levels of Open Source projects which offer similar functionality into account when deciding which one to adopt in your tech stack.
