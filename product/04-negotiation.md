# InnerSource and negotiation skills

## small vs. large changes

* smaller changes tend to be accepted faster
   * easier to review
   * less impact - both, positive and negative
   * faster to integrate
   * ad-hoc for those often works
   * sweet spot for drive-by contributions without much coordination
   * typically don't cause a lot of friction, typically don't cause escalation

* but sometimes large changes are needed
   * learned ad hoc working model breaks
   * escalation quickly happens
   * needs coordination:
     * when does the host team have time for mentoring?
     * when does the contributor have time for being mentored?
     * does the change fit into the host team vision of the project?
     * avoid sending large patches - frustration if they are declined is high on both sides
   * coordination not at tech and business level separately but preferably with everyone at the same table - think of one async communication platform for the InnerSource project.

## Coordination

* in particular larger changes need coordination
   * make sure host team has time for mentoring
   * anticipate longer waiting time otherwise

* coordinate common understanding of the roadmap and vision of the InnerSource project
* make sure that design, architecture and performance requirements are clear to everyone
   * essentially everything that is clear implicitly when working in a local team
   * make time for automated quality checks

* When coordinating think out of the box:
   * contributors can make all of the tedious but smaller and easier fixes, while the host team thus has more time for the more complicated changes that the contributors need

* As a host team product owner you need to understand overall business priority in particular at times where more contributions are flowing in than your team can handle

* Needs an understanding where contributions make sense
   * time invest for contributors worthy?
   * mentoring invest for host team compared to "simply do it yourself quickly"
   * is there a chance the contributor stays active long term?
