# Audience

While the content of this segment can be intersting to engineers in order to help their teams better navigate business decisions related to InnerSource the core audience are people in your team and across your organisation that deal with product development. The goal of this segment is to help you understand how InnerSource can help interdependent teams resolve requirements without syncing work to the point where both teams operate in lock-step.

# Takeaways

After going through this segment, you will:

* understand how Agile software development relates to InnerSource:
   * Which problems does InnerSource address that cause issues in typical agile teams? 
        * "wait it out", "build workarounds" vs. "help with the solution"
        * cross-team collaboration
        * remote first teams
   * In what aspects does InnerSource differ from agile or traditional software development - in particular when the same terminology and technology is used? (Think "Issue tracker for backlog/ board management vs. issue tracker for communication", "code review as quality gate vs. continuous code review as a conversation").
*  understand how even with InnerSource the host team still has to plan time and capacity when receiving features as pull requests as opposed to features requests.
*  understand additional negotiation possibilities that InnerSource brings (think "host teams implements tricky feature request of contributing team, in return the contributing team helps with simpler features that the host teams has higher up on their priority list")

# Outline

InnerSource and Agile

- Issues InnerSource solves
- Common mis-understandings
   - Common fears (like losing control) and counter measures
   - Same phrase - different meaning: How issue trackers and code reviews are used differently in InnerSource projects than is common in the industry.
   - The impact of transparency: How InnerSource depends on trust, what to avoid to keep trust alive.
   
Challenges with InnerSource and agile (these challenges form the basis for the remaining segments in this section).

InnerSource and capacity planning

- Small vs. large changes
- Planning for mentoring
- Contributions as long term investments in your upstream InnerSource project
Representing in roadmap.

The need for negotiation skills in InnerSource projects

- Small vs. large changes - why smaller changes are easier to integrate ad-hoc than large refactorings
- Best practices for integrating large changesets
   - Coordinate a common understanding of the InnerSource project roadmap
   - Up-front product and engineering design review
   - Coordinate the timing of larger contributions
- Unconventional solutions to priority conflicts
- Communicate the need to think in contributions instead of building workarounds.


Options for shared ownership

- Introduce InnerSource governance levels 
   - Governance levels pattern
   - Implications of each level on product management
- Common hurdles (line management, performance review setups)
- Advantages
- Commons issues wrt. operations and solutions
