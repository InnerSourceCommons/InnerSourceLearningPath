    - Remove whitespace discussions from your code reviews - use linters
    - Implement pre-commit hooks to ensure your tests run before PR is submitted
    - If you have to explain anything more than once - move that information into your docs
    - Apply the same diligence in reviewing your team's code as you do with external Contributors

### After the Sprint
