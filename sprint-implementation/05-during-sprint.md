From outline:

### During the Sprint
- TC - ensure that Contributor's supporter is able to prioritize the support work over team backlog
- Helpful tips for PR reviews
    - If you have to explain anything more than once - move that information into your docs
    - Apply the same diligence in reviewing your team's code as you do with external Contributors
- Contributor - help close gaps in the docs to pave the road for future contributors
    - Document what you have learned from PR reviews, if it was not available or unclear prior to the reviews
    - Submit a separate PR for documentation fix, so your change does not have additional dependencies
