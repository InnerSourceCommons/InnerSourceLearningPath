From outline:

### After the Sprint
- TC - remember to demo Contributor's work and recognize their contribution
    - Praise them verbally and in writing, include their peers and their manager
    - Give credit for their enhancements when reporting to your own leadership 
- Contributor - remember to thank your support and offer respectful feedback for future interactions
- Re-establish expectations for post-Production support (link to 30-day warranty pattern)
- What to do if contribution has not been completed
