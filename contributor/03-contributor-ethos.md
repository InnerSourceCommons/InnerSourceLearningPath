 Outline for this section

     Contributors by definition work in teams that they are not familiar with. This section explains how to avoid common pitfalls when crossing team boundaries.

 ## Article

In the last segment we have motivated why you would want to reuse components and become active as a Contributor. This artice is sharing best practices on how to successfully contribute your changes to the host team's code base.

 ### Contributor Ethos

An InnerSource Contributor trying to make a contribution to the host team essentially is a guest in their home. In general a good guest is expected to behave in a certain way:

* They knock at the door.
* They anticipate and follow house rules.
* They understand they are not the home owner and act accordingly.

How do these expectations apply to InnerSource projects?

#### Getting in

In the real world there are several ways that guests are invited in:

* An "open" sign lets them know they can walk right in without knocking.
* Knock on the door unexpected.
* Knock on the door only when invited.

With InnerSource projects there are several ways that code gets in:

Sometimes you just open a pull request. At times you may need to get a feature request accepted before opening the pull request that fulfills it.

In some organisations you may need to talk to the host team in person in addition to interacting with the project digitally. 

In the same way that real-life hosts don't always appreciate a stranger knocking on their door, some InnerSource hosts appreciate some heads-up before seeing a pull request gets opened to their repo. Typically there will be an issue tracker where new features are discussed before being submitted as a pull request. A useful alternative are archived, searchable, linkable but unstructured discussion platforms: Thank of mailing lists, chat plattforms or online fora.

In all of these interactions, be prepared to "sell" your contribution to the host team. Articulate the value that the contribution will bring to their ecosystem.

The host team will be the one taking over maintenance for your changes. It makes sense to offer to fulfill a 30-day warranty on your submission. This can alleviate the host teams' fear of the contributors not being available for support with fixing bugs after the time on contribution.

Many InnerSource projects outline how they like to be approached by potential Contributors in their README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md files. Following those recommendations greatly increases your chances of getting your contribution accepted.

#### Anticipate and follow house rules

The README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md often not only contains information about how to approach the host team, but also guidelines throughout the contribution process. Be sure to understand and follow them.

If you are contributing the fix to an issue, be sure to follow all guidance and instruction documented in the issue.

You should understand the project well enough to know that your contribution makes sense overall and is not just your personal snowflake.


#### Understands they are not the home owner and acts accordingly.

Being a Contributor essentially means being somehow closer to the host team than someone merely requesting a feature. Still Contributors are not accountable for the software project they are contributing to.

As a result the final call on what the contribution must look like is with the host team. It helps to make sure to approach the host team with a humble mindset, with the assumption that all are collaborating towards the purpose of the shared organisation. It helps to be open and transparent - not only about what was implemented how, but also why the change was needed.

Usually it helps to treat feedback as a gift: Others are trying to improve your solution, saving you from trouble further down the road.

There is a chance that the host team does not accept your contribution at all. In that case it helps to work with the team, figure out if there is a sub aspect of what you need that can be solved in their project and solve the remaining issues on your end.

 #### Summary of this segment

In this segment we have learned how to best approach an InnerSource project as a Contributor. We also looked at how to best communicate our need for the change and together with the host team find a solution for that need.
