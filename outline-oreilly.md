# Title

The InnerSource Learning Path

# Description

InnerSource is the application of open source methodologies to internally-developed software.
While simple to define, InnerSource can be difficult to explain and implement successfully.
Many engineers lack background in open source and the ideas and mechanics of open code development.
Even those with that background face a new set of constraints and motivations when trying to work openly within the enterprise.
This learning path gives a simple, easy to understand introduction to InnerSource.
It introduces key terms, concepts, and principles for effective InnerSource along with explanations and real examples.
It is intended to bring newcomers up to speed as well as provide those with experience a common vocabulary to use when discussing more advanced concepts.

# Contents

The learning path contains 4 sections, ordered as:

1. [Introduction]
1. [Trusted Committer]
1. [Contributor]
1. [Product Owner]

Each section has a set of videos (ordering listed at the links above).
Each video in a section is followed immediately by [assessment questions] for that video.
Then comes the next video in the section (followed by its [assessment questions]) and so on.
